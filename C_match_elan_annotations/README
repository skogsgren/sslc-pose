Contains code for extracting ELAN annotations for SSLC files to a JSON file
that is more easily parsed programmatically. The structure of the JSON file
looks like this:

{
    clip_name: [
        {start: TIMESTAMP, end: TIMESTAMP, annotation: GLOSS},
        ...
        ]
}

This is then used in the ../E_combine_dataset to match up the annotations to
the pose inference information.

See documentation in parse.py and cfg.json for further details.
