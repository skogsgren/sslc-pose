contains code for composing a dataset that can then be directly used for research

specifically, it does this:

1. reads cfg.json which contains:

    - `eaf_annotations`: path to json containing elan annotations
      (see ../C_match_elan_annotations/)

    - `pose_inference_path`: path to folder containing json files with MMPOSE
      inferences (see ../D_mmpose_inferences/)

    - `output_dir`: path to where the dataset should be exported.

2. for each video file creates a json with the keypoints of MMPOSE inferences
   and the ELAN token merged, alongside with the exact frame where they occur.
