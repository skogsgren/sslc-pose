Contains code for trimming a folder of video files using FFMPEG and a set of
timestamps for each video file in that folder.

NOTE: the current implementation simply calls FFMPEG using subprocess.run since
I couldn't get the FFMPEG python module to work quite as I wanted.

See ffmpeg_trim.py and cfg.json for more details.
